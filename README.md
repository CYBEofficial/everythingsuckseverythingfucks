### 🎨 Design Philosophy

- ✅ **Deprecated HTML elements** like `<marquee>`
- ✅ **Comic Sans aesthetic** with Impact fonts
- ✅ **Auto-playing elements** and animations
- ✅ **Popup windows** with fake virus warnings
- ✅ **Inline styles** everywhere (linters hate this!)
- ✅ **Maximum visual noise** and chaos
- ✅ **Profanity-laden content** for that authentic edge-lord vibe
